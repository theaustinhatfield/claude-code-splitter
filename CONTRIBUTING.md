# Contributing to Claude Code Splitter

We believe in the power of open source. We also believe in keeping things simple.

## The Philosophy

1.  **Make something people want.** If a feature doesn't solve a real problem, it doesn't belong here.
2.  **Keep it simple.** Complexity is the enemy of reliability.
3.  **Don't break the build.** Ensure your changes work before submitting.

## How to Contribute

1.  **Fork the repo.**
2.  **Create a branch.** `git checkout -b feature/amazing-idea`
3.  **Hack away.**
4.  **Push.** `git push origin feature/amazing-idea`
5.  **Open a Pull Request.** Tell us *why* this change matters.

## Bug Reports

If you find a bug, please open an issue. Be specific. Tell us how to reproduce it.

## Feature Requests

Have an idea? Open an issue. But remember: we prioritize simplicity. If it can be done with a shell script, it probably shouldn't be a core feature.

Happy hacking.
